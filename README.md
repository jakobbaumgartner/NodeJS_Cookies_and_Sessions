# NodeJS_Cookies_and_Sessions
NodeJS Lection.

This is a simple project, designed to repeat new concepts learned. 

No help was provided by anyone, the work was autonomous. 

The puropose of this exercise was to try Sessions, Cookies and Handlebars. 
(Mobile-first design and correct resizing was not a priority.)
