# NodeJS_Cookies_and_Sessions

This is a simple project, using NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, Sessions and others, designed to repeat new concepts learned. 

No help was provided by anyone, the work was autonomous. 

The puropose of this exercise was to try Sessions, Cookies and Handlebars. 
(Mobile-first design and correct resizing was not a priority.)

# What I Learned
-> Cookies </br>
-> Sessions </br>
-> MySQL, Databases </br>
-> Sequelize </br>
-> API reading </br>
-> Handlebars </br>

# Other
-> NodeJS </br>
-> Express </br>
-> BodyParser </br>
-> ...

# What I could fix:

I could make better comments, I could make more structured approach. Better plan in advance. I could spend more time on design of frontend. Maybe add a logout button.
